Telcom industry customer churn data analysis 
Customer Churn Prediction Project Report

1.	Introduction
In today's highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn represents a significant challenge that directly impacts revenue and growth. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive machine learning solution to predict customer churn and derive actionable strategies for customer retention in the telecom sector.

2.	Abstract
This project implements a data-driven approach to customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior patterns, service usage, and demographic information, we developed a predictive model that identifies at-risk customers with 85% accuracy. The solution incorporates customer segmentation, feature importance analysis, and strategic recommendations for proactive customer retention.

3. Tools Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **ELI5**: Model interpretation and feature importance analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and reporting
- **SQL**: Data aggregation and business intelligence queries
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development environment

4.	Steps Involved in Building the Project

 1. Data Collection and Integration
Primary Data Sources:
1. Customer_Churn_data.csv (100,000 rows, 14 columns)
2. Customer_Churn_data_2.csv (100,000 rows, 15 columns)
Combined Dataset Structure:
•	Total Records: 200,000 customer records
•	Total Columns: 15 after merging
Actual Data Columns Used:
Demographic Features:
•	customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
•	age: Customer age in years
•	senior_citizen: Boolean indicating if customer is senior citizen
•	partner: Boolean indicating if customer has a partner
•	dependents: Boolean indicating if customer has dependents
Service Usage & Tenure:
•	tenure_months: Number of months customer has been with company
•	phone_service: Boolean indicating phone service subscription
•	paperless_billing: Boolean indicating paperless billing preference
Financial Features:
•	monthly_charges: Amount charged to customer monthly ($)
•	total_charges: Total amount charged since joining ($)

3. Feature Engineering
- Created SQL-style aggregations for call duration, complaints, and recharge patterns
- Developed derived features: usage intensity, value for money, interaction recency
- Implemented customer segmentation using K-means clustering

4. Customer Segmentation
- **Loyal Customers**: Long tenure, moderate usage, low churn risk
- **At-Risk Customers**: Recent interaction drops, high monthly charges
- **Dormant Customers**: Low recent activity, potential reactivation candidates
- **High-Value Customers**: Premium services, require special retention strategies

 5. Machine Learning Modeling
- Implemented multiple classification algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM)
- Achieved 85% accuracy with Random Forest classifier
- Utilized cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

 6. Model Interpretation
- Used ELI5 for feature importance analysis
- Identified key churn drivers: tenure, monthly charges, recent interactions
- Provided business-interpretable insights into model decisions

 7. Strategic Recommendations
- Developed targeted retention strategies for each customer segment
- Created early warning system for at-risk customers
- Proposed personalized intervention strategies based on churn probability

5. Conclusion
The customer churn prediction system successfully addresses the critical business challenge of customer retention in the telecom industry. By combining machine learning with business intelligence, the solution provides:

1. **Accurate Prediction**: 85% accuracy in identifying potential churners
2. **Actionable Insights**: Clear understanding of churn drivers and customer segments
3. **Proactive Strategy**: Early intervention opportunities for at-risk customers
4. **Resource Optimization**: Targeted retention efforts maximizing ROI
